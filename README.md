### My process
I love clean readable code. So I tried to keep it as just that, incldung a flowchart and a plan in mind!


### Built with

- Custom CSS
- Custom HTML
- Vanilla JavaScript
- DOM manipulation
- Clean code


### What I learned

Back when I built this app, I had learned alot, from DOM manipulation usage and clean code. I hadn't at the time implemented restrictions to numbers or button usage upon winning, but when I did I learned a lot of that process that has of course stuck with me!
